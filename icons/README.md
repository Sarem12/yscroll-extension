# Icons for YScroll

## Required Icons

You need to create three PNG icon files:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Design

The icon should feature:
- White background with rounded corners
- Blue "Y" letter (color: #3b82f6)
- Bold, modern font

## Quick Creation Methods

### Method 1: Using icon.svg
1. Open `icon.svg` in a browser or image editor
2. Export/save as PNG at different sizes:
   - 16x16 → icon16.png
   - 48x48 → icon48.png
   - 128x128 → icon128.png

### Method 2: Online Tools
Use online icon generators like:
- https://favicon.io/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.canva.com/
- https://icons8.com/

### Method 3: Design Software
Use Figma, Sketch, Photoshop,Adobe Illustrator, or GIMP to create the icons manually.

## Temporary Workaround

If you want to test the extension without proper icons, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Use any existing PNG images renamed to the required filenames
3. The extension will still work, just without proper branding

## Note

The `icon.svg` file is provided as a template. You'll need to convert it to PNG files at the required sizes for the extension to work properly.
